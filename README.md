### This is **VESP** demo

VESP means:
* Vue.js frontend (+ Nuxt.js)
* Eloquent ORM
* Slim3 micro-framework
* Phinx migrations


PHP core was inspired by MODX Revolution, so it may not follow modern best practices, but could be interest for MODX developers.

Feel free to use it as a starter template for your services with Vue.js frontend and REST API backend.
